# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction & Model Explainability App

**A full-scale, production-ready, ML-powered web application for accurate housing price prediction and model explainability, built by [Sweety Seelam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sweetyrao670/).**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Housing price prediction is a critical real-world problem for real estate, banking, fintech, and proptech sectors.  
This application enables you to **predict house prices** using advanced machine learning models, visualize model performance, and understand predictions via SHAP and LIME explainability.

---

## **Business Problem:**  
  Accurate price estimation enables smarter investments, transparent lending, risk reduction, and optimized sales for platforms like Housing.com, Realtor.com, Zillow, Redfin, and major banks.

---

## **Key Features:**  
  - Large-scale regression models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (all trained & tuned).
  - Upload your own data or test on a live demo sample.
  - **Model Explainability:** See why each prediction is made using SHAP & LIME.
  - Multi-page interactive navigation, error analysis, and visual analytics.
  - Business value, recommendations, and ROI simulation for companies.
  - Original dataset: **Indian Rupees (₹)**; all predictions displayed as `₹INR / $USD` (with conversion at 1 USD = 83 INR, Jun 2025).
  - MIT License, fully credited and open for learning, research, or enterprise use.

## 📈 Model Performance (Test Set)

All results are **from your final Jupyter analysis and used in the deployed app**.

| Model               | R² Score | MSE         | MAE              |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.70     | 9.97e+11    | ₹706,979 / $8,522 |
| Ridge Regression    | 0.70     | 9.98e+11    | ₹734,026 / $8,847 |
| Lasso Regression    | 0.69     | 1.00e+12    | ₹735,049 / $8,859 |
| Random Forest       | 0.64     | 1.19e+12    | ₹776,471 / $9,356 |
| Linear Regression   | 0.69     | 1.00e+12    | ~₹735,000 / $8,859 |

- **Interpretation:**  
  - Best model (Gradient Boosting) explains 70% of price variance, with average prediction error (MAE) of about ₹707K / $8.5K per house.
  - Business-level predictions are robust, though errors may increase for rare/unusual properties.
